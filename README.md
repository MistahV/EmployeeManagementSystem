# Application Name: Employee Management System


## Description

Welcome to your very own Employee Management System! In any complex business, there are multiple departments to keep track of - each with their own unique job roles and employees. Viewing and updating such information is normally a tricky, time-consuming process. However, with this application, you will easily be able to organize and access all of this information with just a few clicks of your keyboard.

The Employee Management System, in conjunction with Node, Inquirer, and MySQL, will allow you to view all of your business's information in an organized format in your terminal. You can choose just to view existing information, or you can add new information - all of it will be stored in a MySQL database.

This application should be ready to go right from download. You may need to do an 'npm install' command with the package.json file in your CLI to ensure that Inquirer and all necessary packages are installed, and you will need to make sure your MySQL database is seeded and ready to run. When you're ready, simply open up the application in your integrated terminal, and enter 'node server.js' to start. You will be presented with a menu, through which you can choose to view department, employee, and/or job role information, or even add those departments, employees, and roles - all through your CLI!
